*Will have a look at previous projects and get back to you; depends on the context* **#technology**

*+1 for Rails. I'm less certain about vouching for specific 3rd party libraries beyond Rails though, what do you think Alice, Brian?* **#technology**



Alice (developer) responded (____ PDT)

Joseph (investor) responded (____ GMT)

*This is an MVP, please don't go overboard with features, path to profitability needs to be quick in this context.* **#use-case**



Abi (developer) responded (______ GMT)

*I have worked at a social media company previously. Feedback from users is essential once you reach a certain point - metrics don't tell the full story.* **#experience**
